# my-blog
My personal blog, made with Django and Bootstrap.

## Features

Has typical features of a basic blog. Since it's my personal blog I decided against integrating user accounts in favor of simplicity. At this time, there is also no comment system on posts.

- On homepage:
  - Three most recent featured posts displayed at top of page
  - Latest post are displayed below featured, with pagination
- Sort posts by category
- On each post page, displays: title, summary, author, created on, updated on, and category
- Publications page with detailed, citation style info for each of your works
- About page for further info about you, the blog, etc.
- Contact page
- Basic search function that searches post title, summary, and body
- Footer with about me blurb, quick links, and social media links
